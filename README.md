# donut
Donut in C#, Vibecoded

# Compile

To compile your donut you must do "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe" /t:winexe /out:Donut.exe Donut.cs /r:System.Drawing.dll /r:System.Windows.Forms.dll 

It works, Unless you wanna suffer making a .csproj to compile using dontet build, then do it i guess

# Run

Running is easy, you just do Donut.exe in your build folder

# Known Bugs

Donut sometimes flickers, GPT-OSS-120B's fault, It's okay, it works
